# Iranian E-Commerce & Classifieds API Clients

This repository contains a collection of Python-based toolkits for interacting with the internal APIs of popular Iranian web platforms. Each client is designed to programmatically search, discover, and extract structured data, providing a more efficient and reliable alternative to traditional web scraping of HTML.

## üöÄ Projects

This collection currently includes the following clients:

-   **[Jabama API Client](/jabama_scraper):**
    A three-stage client for scraping accommodation data from Jabama. It allows for the discovery of search keywords, extraction of dynamic filters, and execution of targeted searches for properties.

-   **[Divar API Client](/divar_scraper):**
    A comprehensive four-stage client for Divar, Iran's largest classifieds platform. It systematically handles suggestion discovery, filter extraction, filtered ad searching, and the retrieval of full post details.

-   **[Digikala API Client](/digikala_scraper):**
    A powerful toolkit for the Digikala e-commerce platform. It features advanced product search with filters, autocomplete discovery for finding categories and brands, and detailed report generation for any product URL.

**For detailed instructions on installation and usage for each client, please refer to the `README.md` file located inside its respective project folder.**

## üîß Core Technology

-   **Language:** Python 3
-   **Primary Library:** `requests` for handling all HTTP API calls.
-   **Data Format:** All outputs are structured in clean, machine-readable `JSON` format.

## üí° Purpose

This collection is designed for educational and research purposes to demonstrate modern API interaction and data extraction techniques. It serves as a strong portfolio piece showcasing the ability to reverse-engineer and interact with undocumented APIs in a structured, multi-stage workflow.
